Problem Statement
Given a sentence composed of words separated by spaces, find the longest word that is a palindrome. If multiple palindromic words share the maximum length, return the first occurrence. If no palindromes exist, return "NO PALINDROME".

A palindrome reads the same backward as forward (e.g., madam, kayak, racecar).

Input Format
A single line of input containing a sentence with 1 to 100 words.

Each word consists of lowercase letters only (no punctuation or numbers).

Output Format
Print the longest palindromic word.

If none exist, print "NO PALINDROME".

Constraints
Each word has a maximum length of 100 characters.
The entire sentence length does not exceed 10,000 characters.
Case-sensitive: Input is strictly lowercase.

Examples
Sample Input	Sample Output
level civic kayak madam racecar apple banana	racecar
hello world openai chatgpt	NO PALINDROME
Explanation
First Example:

Palindromic words: level, civic, kayak, madam, racecar.
Longest: racecar (length 7).

Second Example:
No palindromic words â†’ "NO PALINDROME".

Solution Approach
Split the Sentence: Separate words by spaces.

Check Palindromes: For each word, verify if it matches its reverse.
Track Longest: Maintain the longest palindrome encountered, prioritizing the first if ties occur.
Edge Handling: Return "NO PALINDROME" if no valid word is found.
